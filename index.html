            <h3>Pepper Spray</h3>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Pepper spray is a self-defense product that contains a concentrated form of capsaicin, the chemical that gives chili peppers their spicy heat. When sprayed into a person's eyes or face, it causes intense burning, pain, and temporary blindness.    </p>

            <h3>How it Works:
            </h3>
            <p>Irritation: Capsaicin irritates the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth, causing intense pain and discomfort.   
                Disorientation: The sudden onset of pain and temporary blindness can disorient an attacker, giving you time to escape or seek help.   
                Deterring Aggression: The unpleasant experience of being sprayed with pepper spray can deter future attacks.  </p>
